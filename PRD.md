# CollabCanvas MVP - Product Requirements Document

**Project**: CollabCanvas - Real-Time Collaborative Design Tool  
**Goal**: Build a solid multiplayer foundation with basic canvas functionality

**Note**: AI features are intentionally not part of this MVP and will be addressed in future phases.

---

## Canvas Architecture (MVP)

**Single Global Canvas Approach:**

- MVP features ONE shared global canvas that all authenticated users access
- No project creation or management in MVP
- No canvas selection or dashboard
- All users collaborate on the same shared canvas space
- Future: Will add multi-project support with separate canvases per project

**URL Structure:**

- Simple route (e.g., `/canvas` or just `/`)
- No dynamic canvas IDs needed for MVP

---

## User Stories

### Primary User: Designer/Creator (MVP Priority)

- As a designer, I want to **create an account and log in** so that my work is associated with my identity
- As a designer, I want to **see a large canvas workspace** so that I have room to design
- As a designer, I want to **pan and zoom the canvas smoothly** so that I can navigate my design space
- As a designer, I want to **create basic shapes (rectangles)** so that I can build simple designs
- As a designer, I want to **move objects around the canvas** so that I can arrange my design
- As a designer, I want to **delete objects I've created** so that I can remove mistakes or unwanted elements
- As a designer, I want to **see other users' cursors with their names** so that I know who's working where
- As a designer, I want to **see changes made by other users in real-time** so that we can collaborate seamlessly
- As a designer, I want to **see who else is currently online** so that I know who I'm collaborating with
- As a designer, I want my **work to persist when I leave** so that I don't lose progress

**Note:** Focus on completing all Designer/Creator user stories before addressing Collaborator needs.

### Secondary User: Collaborator (Implement After Primary User)

- As a collaborator, I want to **join an existing canvas session** so that I can work with my team
- As a collaborator, I want to **see all existing objects when I join** so that I have full context
- As a collaborator, I want to **make changes without conflicts** so that multiple people can work simultaneously

## Key Features for MVP

### 1. Authentication System

**Must Have:**

- User registration via email/password (Firebase Auth)
- Google social login (Firebase Auth)
- User login/logout
- Persistent user sessions
- User display names visible to collaborators

**Display Name Logic:**

- Use Google display name if signing in via Google
- Use email prefix (before @) if signing in via email/password
- Display truncated version if name is too long (max 20 chars)

**Success Criteria:**

- Users can create accounts and maintain sessions across page refreshes
- Each user has a unique identifier and display name

### 2. Canvas Workspace

**Must Have:**

- Large canvas area (5000x5000px virtual space)
- Smooth pan functionality (click-and-drag)
- Zoom functionality (mousewheel or pinch)
- Visual grid or reference points (optional but helpful)
- Hard boundaries at canvas edges
- 60 FPS performance during all interactions

**Canvas Boundaries:**

- Objects cannot be placed or moved outside boundaries (5000x5000px)
- Drag operations stop at boundary edges
- Visual edge indicators (subtle border or shading) - optional but nice to have

**Success Criteria:**

- Canvas feels responsive and smooth
- No lag during pan/zoom operations
- Can handle at least 500 rectangles without performance degradation
- Objects are constrained within canvas boundaries

### 3. Shape Creation & Manipulation

**Must Have:**

- **Rectangles only for MVP** (circles and text out of scope)
- Ability to create new rectangles (click/drag or button)
- Ability to select shapes (click)
- Ability to move shapes (drag)
- Visual feedback for selected objects
- Fixed styling (gray fill color for all shapes)

**Selection Behavior:**

- Clicking a different shape automatically deselects the previous shape
- Only one shape can be selected at a time (multi-select out of scope)
- Clicking empty canvas deselects current selection

**Success Criteria:**

- Shape creation is intuitive and immediate
- Drag operations are smooth and responsive
- Selected state is clearly visible
- Selection behavior is predictable and consistent

### 4. Real-Time Synchronization

**Must Have:**

- Broadcast shape creation to all users (<100ms)
- Broadcast shape movements to all users (<100ms)
- Broadcast shape deletions to all users (<100ms)
- Handle concurrent edits without breaking
- Object locking: First user to select/drag an object locks it for editing
- Locked objects cannot be moved by other users simultaneously
- Visual indicator showing which user has locked an object
- Auto-release lock when user stops dragging

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**

- First user to start moving an object acquires the lock
- Other users cannot move the locked object until lock is released
- Lock automatically releases after drag completes or timeout (3-5 seconds)
- Clear visual feedback when attempting to move a locked object

**Success Criteria:**

- Object changes visible to all users within 100ms
- No "ghost objects" or desync issues
- No simultaneous edits to the same object
- Clear visual feedback when an object is locked by another user
- Lock automatically releases after drag completes

### 5. Multiplayer Cursors

**Must Have:**

- Show cursor position for each connected user
- Display user name near cursor
- Update cursor positions in real-time (<50ms)
- Unique color per user

**Cursor Colors:**

- Randomly assigned from predefined color palette on user join
- Ensure sufficient contrast against white/light backgrounds
- Maintain color consistency per user throughout session

**Success Criteria:**

- Cursors move smoothly without jitter
- Names are readable and don't obscure content
- Cursor updates don't impact canvas performance
- Each user has a distinct, visible cursor color

### 6. Shape Deletion

**Must Have:**

- Delete selected shape with Delete/Backspace key
- Broadcast deletion to all users in real-time
- Deleted shapes removed from database immediately
- Cannot delete shapes locked by other users

**Success Criteria:**

- Deletion is instant and syncs across all clients within 100ms
- No "ghost shapes" after deletion
- Deleted shapes permanently removed from persistent storage

### 7. Presence Awareness

**Must Have:**

- List of currently connected users
- Real-time join/leave notifications
- Visual indicator of online status

**Success Criteria:**

- Users can see who's in the session at all times
- Join/leave events update immediately

### 8. State Persistence

**Must Have:**

- Load canvas state on page load
- Persist through disconnects and reconnects
- Multiple users can rejoin and see same state

**Success Criteria:**

- All users leave and return â†’ work is still there
- Page refresh doesn't lose data
- New users joining see complete current state

### 9. Deployment

**Must Have:**

- Publicly accessible URL
- Stable hosting for 5+ concurrent users
- No setup required for users

**Success Criteria:**

## Data Model

### Firestore Collection: `canvas` (single document for MVP)

**Document ID:** `global-canvas-v1`

```json
{
  "canvasId": "global-canvas-v1",
  "shapes": [
    {
      "id": "shape_uuid_1",
      "type": "rectangle",
      "x": 100,
      "y": 200,
      "width": 150,
      "height": 100,
      "fill": "#cccccc",
      "createdBy": "user_id",
      "createdAt": "timestamp",
      "lastModifiedBy": "user_id",
      "lastModifiedAt": "timestamp",
      "isLocked": false,
      "lockedBy": null
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

### Firebase Realtime Database: `presence` (for cursors)

```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "global-canvas-v1": {
      "user_id_1": {
        "displayName": "John Doe",
        "cursorColor": "#FF5733",
        "cursorX": 450,
        "cursorY": 300,
        "lastSeen": "timestamp"
      },
      "user_id_2": {
        "displayName": "Jane Smith",
        "cursorColor": "#33C1FF",
        "cursorX": 620,
        "cursorY": 180,
        "lastSeen": "timestamp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Two Databases?**

- Firestore: For persistent canvas state (shapes, metadata)
- Realtime Database: For high-frequency updates (cursor positions, presence)
- Realtime Database has lower latency for cursor movements

## Proposed Tech Stack

### Option 1: Firebase (Recommended for Speed)

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite
- Konva.js for canvas rendering
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Backend:**

- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore for state persistence
- Firebase Realtime Database for cursor positions

**Pros:**

- Fastest setup (authentication is plug-and-play)
- Built-in real-time capabilities
- Generous free tier
- Automatic scaling
- Simple deployment with Firebase Hosting

**Cons:**

- Vendor lock-in to Google
- Firestore queries can be expensive at scale
- Less control over backend logic

**Pitfalls to Watch:**

- Firestore charges per read/write - optimize updates
- Need to structure data carefully (avoid deep nesting)
- Realtime Database better for cursor positions (lower latency)

---

### Option 2: Supabase + WebSockets

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite
- Konva.js for canvas rendering
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Backend:**

- Supabase Auth
- Supabase PostgreSQL for state persistence
- Supabase Realtime for updates

**Pros:**

- Open source alternative to Firebase
- PostgreSQL is more flexible than Firestore
- Built-in real-time subscriptions
- Better for complex queries later

**Cons:**

- Slightly more setup than Firebase
- Realtime can be tricky with high-frequency updates
- Free tier has connection limits

**Pitfalls to Watch:**

- Realtime subscriptions count against connection limits
- Need to handle reconnection logic carefully
- Cursor updates might need separate WebSocket channel

---

### Option 3: Custom Backend (Express + Socket.io)

**Frontend:**

- React + Vite
- Konva.js for canvas rendering
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Backend:**

- Node.js + Express
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL for persistence
- Custom authentication or Auth0

**Pros:**

- Complete control over architecture
- Socket.io is purpose-built for real-time
- Can optimize exactly for your use case
- No vendor lock-in

**Cons:**

- Most time-consuming to build
- Need to build authentication from scratch
- More deployment complexity
- Need to manage scaling yourself

**Pitfalls to Watch:**

- Authentication takes significant time
- Need to handle WebSocket reconnection
- Scaling WebSockets requires sticky sessions
- More potential for bugs in custom code

---

## Recommended Stack for MVP

**Frontend:** React + Vite + Konva.js + Tailwind  
**Backend:** Firebase (Authentication + Firestore + Realtime Database)  
**Deployment:** Firebase Hosting or Vercel

**Rationale:** Given the 24-hour constraint, Firebase provides the fastest path to a working MVP. Authentication is solved, real-time is built-in, and deployment is simple. You can always migrate later if needed.

## Known Limitations & Trade-offs

1. **Single Global Canvas**: All users share one global canvas (multi-project support in Phase 2)
2. **Basic Shapes**: Rectangles only (other shapes in future releases)
3. **Simple Locking**: First-come lock mechanism (not CRDT or OT)
4. **No Styling**: Fixed gray fill color for all rectangles
5. **No History**: No undo/redo or version control
6. **Desktop Only**: Not optimized for mobile/tablet
7. **Fixed Canvas Size**: 5000x5000px limit (not infinite canvas)
8. **No Permissions**: All users have equal edit access

---

## Success Metrics for MVP Checkpoint

1. **Two users can edit simultaneously** in different browsers
2. **Page refresh mid-edit** preserves all state
3. **Multiple shapes created rapidly** sync without visible lag
4. **Locking works correctly** - only one user can move an object at a time
5. **60 FPS maintained** during all interactions
6. **Deployed and accessible** via public URL

## Risk Mitigation

**Biggest Risk:** Real-time sync breaking under load  
**Mitigation:** Test with multiple browsers early and often; use Firebase Realtime Database for high-frequency updates

**Second Risk:** Performance degradation with many objects  
**Mitigation:** Use canvas-based rendering (Konva), not DOM elements; limit to 500 shapes for MVP

**Third Risk:** Locking mechanism causing deadlocks  
**Mitigation:** Implement automatic lock timeout (3-5 seconds); clear visual feedback for lock state

**Fourth Risk:** Cursor updates causing performance issues  
**Mitigation:** Use Firebase Realtime Database (not Firestore) for cursor positions; throttle updates to 20-30 FPS
