## 🔄 Future Deployments

To deploy updates:

```bash
cd /Users/nat/CanvasCollab/collabcanvas

# Build and test locally
npm run build

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod --yes
```

Or let GitHub Actions handle it automatically (if you set up CI/CD).

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

```bash
# Start local development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod --yes

# View deployment logs
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Build Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Bundle Size**: 1.19 MB (315 KB gzipped)
- **Initial Load**: Fast (code splitting recommended for future)
- **Real-time Latency**: < 100ms (Firebase Realtime Database)

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

Test these features on your live deployment:

- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with Google
- [ ] Create rectangle, circle, and text shapes
- [ ] Drag shapes around canvas
- [ ] Resize shapes using corner handles
- [ ] Delete selected shapes
- [ ] Edit text content
- [ ] Pan and zoom canvas
- [ ] Open in 2+ browsers/tabs and test real-time sync
- [ ] Verify user presence indicators
- [ ] Check editing labels appear correctly
- [ ] Test object locking (try editing same shape in 2 tabs)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App shows blank page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Firebase authorized domains include Vercel URL
- Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### Authentication not working
- Make sure Vercel domain is in Firebase authorized domains
- Check Firebase Auth is enabled (Email/Password + Google)
- Verify environment variables are correct

### Real-time sync not working
- Check Firebase Realtime Database rules
- Check Firestore security rules
- Verify Firebase Database URL is correct

### Shapes not appearing
- Check Firestore has `canvas` collection
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check browser console for permission errors

## 🎨 Next Steps

### Recommended Improvements
1. Set up custom domain (e.g., `collabcanvas.com`)
2. Add analytics (Vercel Analytics or Google Analytics)
3. Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
4. Implement code splitting for better performance
5. Add more shape types (lines, arrows, images)
6. Add undo/redo functionality
7. Add export to PNG/SVG
8. Add shape grouping
9. Add layers panel
10. Add comments/annotations

### Optional Enhancements
- Dark mode
- Keyboard shortcuts
