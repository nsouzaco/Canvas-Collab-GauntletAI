# Deploy to Firebase (if using Firebase Hosting)
firebase deploy

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

## üîß Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see Setup Instructions)
4. Run development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:5173

## üì± Testing Multi-User Features
1. Open the app in multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Sign in with different accounts
3. Create shapes and see them sync in real-time
4. Move your mouse to see multiplayer cursors
5. Try editing the same shape simultaneously to see object locking
