# ✅ CollabCanvas - Fixed Deployment

## 🎉 Environment Variables Fixed!

The URL encoding issue has been resolved. Environment variables have been cleaned and re-added without newlines.

## 🌐 Latest Production URL

```
https://collabcanvas-awapvgdxs-natalyscst-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
```

## 🔥 IMPORTANT: Update Firebase Authorized Domains

You need to authorize this new Vercel domain in Firebase:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanvas-71e95/authentication/settings

2. **Scroll down to "Authorized domains" section**

3. **Click "Add domain"**

4. **Add this domain**:
   ```
   collabcanvas-awapvgdxs-natalyscst-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
   ```

5. **Click "Add"**

6. **Also add these previous domains** (if not already added):
   - `collabcanvas-cuuk8xx97-natalyscst-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app`
   - `collabcanvas-be0n16ahk-natalyscst-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app`
   - `collabcanvas-seven.vercel.app` (if you have a custom domain)

### Why Multiple Domains?

Vercel creates a new URL for each deployment. All deployment URLs remain accessible, so it's good to authorize them all.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Environment variables contained newline characters (`%0A`) which caused:
```
Illegal url for new iframe - ...firebaseapp.com%0A/__/auth/iframe...
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed all old environment variables
- Re-added them using `printf` to ensure no newlines
- Redeployed the app

**Result**: Clean environment variables without URL encoding issues!

## 🧪 Testing Your App

1. Open: https://collabcanvas-awapvgdxs-natalyscst-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
2. Try signing up with email/password
3. Try signing in with Google (after authorizing domain in Firebase)
4. Create shapes and test real-time collaboration

## 📝 Quick Checklist

Then add the new deployment URL to Firebase authorized domains.

## 🎨 Your App is Ready!

Once you've added the domain to Firebase, your CollabCanvas MVP will be fully functional!
